## Problem Statement
Personalized Academic & Career Guidance Using Agentic AI

Students today struggle to make informed academic and career decisions due to rapidly changing industry requirements and the absence of tailored guidance systems. While vast information about courses, skills, and careers is available online, it is often fragmented, generic, and disconnected from an individual student’s background, interests, and long-term goals.

Most existing guidance platforms suffer from the following limitations:

Lack of Personalization:
Guidance is usually one-size-fits-all, ignoring a student’s academic history, strengths, aspirations, and preferred career domains.

Non-Contextual Recommendations:
Systems fail to retain conversational memory or past interactions, resulting in repetitive, shallow, and inconsistent advice.

Academic–Industry Disconnect:
Students are unable to clearly map academic choices (courses, electives, certifications) to real-world job roles and evolving market demands.

Low Actionability:
Recommendations are often descriptive rather than prescriptive, offering little clarity on “what to do next.”

Need for the System

There is a critical need for an intelligent, context-aware, and adaptive guidance system that can:

Understand individual student goals and academic context

Retain memory of past interactions for continuity

Bridge the gap between education pathways and industry skills

Provide structured, step-by-step academic and career roadmaps

## Proposed Direction

The Personalized Academic & Career Guidance System addresses this need by leveraging Agentic AI, Large Language Models, and Vector Databases (FAISS) to deliver grounded, personalized, and actionable guidance. By acting as both an Academic Advisor and a Career Counselor, the system supports students in confidently navigating academic planning and career decision-making.
